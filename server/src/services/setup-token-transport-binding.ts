// The production transport binding for the Claude setup-token login session.
//
// The session service (`setup-token-session.ts`) drives the login flow over
// three injected components: a lease manager, a login-process factory, and a
// durable cleanup store. The router (`agents.ts`) accepts these components as an
// optional `setupTokenLogin` transport and falls back to a deferred, fail-closed
// default when a caller omits it. This module builds the production transport, so
// `app.ts` binds it one time at startup.
//
// The binding passes only the fixed command `CLAUDE_SETUP_TOKEN_COMMAND` to the
// login runner. It never accepts a command from a route, a request
// body, or an adapter configuration.
//
// The live pseudo-terminal opener is a separate seam. The Daytona sandbox
// provider runs as a plugin worker, so the server process does not hold the raw
// sandbox process. The real opener binds inside the worker; this module accepts
// it through `openLivePtySession`. A test injects a fake sandbox opener to drive
// the full session path. The live opener lands with the characterization
// test against a real sandbox.
