/**
 * Central reservation + ownership mediation for `tailscale_https` app/HMR port
 * pairs (PAP-17419, from the PAP-17251 finding).
 *
 * ## Why this module exists
 *
 * Before it, "is this pair free?" was answered by three unrelated views that
 * never had to agree:
 *
 *  1. the allocator's liveness probe — is anything *listening* right now,
 *  2. `collectReservedExposurePorts` — persisted rows, but only those whose
 *     `exposure.state` was not yet `removed`,
 *  3. the broker's Serve mapping — consulted nowhere on the allocation path.
 *
 * A workspace can hold an exclusive lease on a pair while satisfying none of
 * those: stop the backend and the listener is gone; tear the exposure down and
 * the row goes `stopped` with `exposure.state = "removed"` **and an emptied
 * `listeners` array**, so the row stops contributing anything to the reserved
 * set even though its `port` column still names the pair the lease owns. That
 * is exactly how the pair leased to workspace `b7ce28b4` (`42001/52001`) was
 * handed to the unrelated workspace `PAP-16986-add-posthog-mcp`, while
 * Paperclip went on reporting the leased lane `stopped` and its exposure
 * `removed`.
 *
 * ## The mediation this module centralizes
 *
 * - **Reservation follows the lease, not the process.** An execution workspace
 *   whose lease is still open reserves its pair through stop, teardown, and
 *   `removed` — until the lease is explicitly released. {@link
 *   buildExposureReservationLedger} derives the pair from the row's `port`
 *   column precisely because teardown erases `exposure.listeners`.
 * - **Complete mediation on allocation.** {@link findExposurePairConflict}
 *   checks the persisted ledger *and* the live listener owner *and* the Serve
 *   mapping owner. Any of the three disagreeing fails the allocation closed,
 *   naming the conflicting workspace/issue.
 * - **No adoption across execution workspaces, ever.** {@link
 *   isExposureAdoptionPermitted} is the single predicate for "may this claimant
 *   take over that holder's port", and it answers no whenever the two execution
 *   workspace IDs are not the identical, non-null value.
 * - **Drift is surfaced, not silently reused.** {@link
 *   findExposureReservationDrift} reports a `stopped`/`removed` row whose
 *   reserved ports are live or mapped by someone else, so reconciliation can
 *   report a false-`stopped` lane instead of recycling it.
 *
 * Pure functions and one in-process claim registry: no sockets, no DB, no
 * broker. Every caller injects its own view, which is what makes all five
 * PAP-17419 regression cases testable without touching host Serve state.
