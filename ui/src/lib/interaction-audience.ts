/**
 * Plain-language presentation of *who may resolve* an issue-thread interaction
 * (PAP-17280, Phase 3 of the open-default resolver contract in
 * `doc/SPEC-implementation.md` §9.8.1).
 *
 * The product default is open: an interaction created without an explicit
 * `resolverPolicy` is resolvable by `anyone` in the company — the board or any
 * agent, including the agent that created it. `not_creator`, `human_only`, and a
 * named addressee are *narrowing* controls that a requester asks for on purpose.
 *
 * This module is presentation only. It never decides authority: the server
 * evaluator owns that, and every downstream effect re-runs its own
 * authorization (see the Phase 1S security verdict on PAP-17278). Everything
 * here is derived from the server-provided snapshot fields
 * (`requestedResolverPolicy`, `effectiveResolverPolicy`,
 * `effectiveResolverPolicySource`, `resolverPolicyProvenance`) so the copy a
 * reader sees agrees with the policy the server will apply.
